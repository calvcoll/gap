  <p>This page contains the current details about what skills I currently have, or any experience that I have from previous work experience in certain domains of expertise.
  <h2><a id="software">Software Development Skills</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a id="agile">Agile Development Skills</a></li>
      <ul><p>I have had experience in developing with the agile ideology. In which I believe that the use of a product backlog and sprint backlog was incredibly useful for our understanding of what we were developing and how far we have progressed during the timeline of the project, and we could check our backlog against the deadline to decide whether we needed more work. This work was completed during the U08007 Business Computing module in my Computer Science course.</p></ul>
    <li><a id="c-sharp">C# experience</a></li>
      <ul><p>I have, during my holidays from university, been working with other languages that the university hasn't yet covered, such as C#. This lanaguage I have used to develop applications in Silverlight, a web application framework by Microsoft using C# as it's language. A notible use of Silverlight is with Netflix, so some experience I believe is required. I have written a lightweight game in this language titled Dotshot, which is currently closed source.</p></ul>
    <li><a id="mvc">MVC Experience</a></li>
      <ul><p>I have developing a Ruby on Rails based backend for this application which will not be completed for the upload of the assignment, so I have not uploaded it. But my previous experience with MVC has included extra-curricular work with a lecturer in the Computing department, writing in C#, a web app.</p></ul>
    <li><a id="sql">SQL Experience</a></li>
      <ul><p>I have used SQL to administer a database setup by server applications used by a gaming group that I am a member of, whilst also being on the administration team. I have used it to delete/drop tables, select player records and modify them for as necessary. My main experience is with the MySQL server infrastructure.</p></ul>
    <li><a id="jshtmlcss">JS/HTML/CSS Experience</a></li>
      <ul><p>I have written many websites that require a combination of the above skills. These skills have been with and without libraries that are wide-spread throughout the industry, such as JQuery. I am part of the development team of a well known Tweetdeck CSS theme, Snowflake Classic Black; contributing a majority of code to the repository, keeping it up-to-date with the changes that Twitter imposes upon the web application. My HMTL experience has helped me create this website/collection of webpages for this portfolio.</p></ul>
    <li><a id="unix">Unix Scripting</a></li>
      <ul><p>I have had experience administering unix web servers, as part of the previously stated admininstration of the SQL servers. However, most of my experience with Unix comes from working almost everyday on a Unix machine, which is running a well known Linux distribution Ubuntu. I have a deep knowledge of the CLI of Linux, Mac and Windows, which has been generated through the experience with Ubuntu.</p></ul>
    <li><a id="ruby">Ruby Experience</a></li>
      <ul><p>My experience with Ruby has been through multiple programs that I have created throughout my exposure with the language. Such as a stock checker for a popular product, so that I could be alerted automatically to availability. Another application I have created rather recently was a program that would generate all the possibilities of an anagram and match it to a dictionary word to find the correct work that had been scrambled.</p></ul>
    <li><a id="graphics">Graphics Programming Experience</a></li>
      <ul><p>My experience with graphical programming does not run into usage of C/C++ base level functions with OpenGL, however, I have had brief experience with 3D visual programming in Java, with some libraries such as LWJGL, and 3D object generation, when modifying the Minecraft Game Engine. I have had experience however with light C++ programming with SDL to write 2D applications, and have written a feature complete game engine in conjuction with Slick2D for a game I had designed but never finished due to university requiring a majority of my time.</p></ul>
    <li><a id="game">Game Programming Experience</a></li>
      <ul><p>My experience with game programming is mentioned slightly before in the previous section. But I have written a game engine for a Zelda, JRPG styled game; with asset creation by other friends with better visual skills. This code is currently closed source as well, as the code can be more optimised than it is currently written. This program was written in Java with good use of the object orientated ideology.</p></ul>
