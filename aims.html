  <h2>Jobs</h2>
  <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
  <p>I retrieved information about being a software engineer, and game development, from multiple sources, mainly from job offers from Reed, and these can be found here: <a href="http://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/back-end-developer/26948939#/jobs/developer">1</a> <a href="http://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/javascript-developer-javascript-ruby-agileunix/26890576#/jobs/developer">2</a> <a href="http://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/developer-software-integration/26948900#/jobs/developer">3</a>

      <li><a href="skills.html#game">Previous game programming experience</a></li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Train Driver</h3>
    <p>I don't believe I have any information to prove these facts, as currently I cannot show this due to a lack of experience in the workplace, with references to back up the facts.</p>
    <p>It seems to be difficult to bring up a list that tells you what is required to become a trainee train driver, as currently companies are mainly hiring pre-trained drivers. I have found some information on a forum <a href="http://www.railforums.co.uk/showthread.php?s=0df2e4ae3ef7417b7efd5b8c1b6c61d5&t=17674">here</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dedication to professionalism</li>
        <li>Dedication to reliability</li>
        <li>Dedication to safety and communication</li>
        <li>Knowledge of Local Area, including train depots, routes, etc</li>
        <li>High co-ordination</li>
        <li>High concentration</li>
        <li>Mechanical Knowledge</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Airliner Pilot</h3>
    <p>This is for an entry level pilot, in the 'Future Pilot' program that most airlines offer to potential employees. Most entry level criteria is very vague and not specific, so not much can be gained from websites.</p>
    <p>The following link, was accessed on February 20th 2015, whilst the application window was open for the airline. <a href="http://www.ctcwings.com/bafuturepilot/selection">British Airways</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bachelors Degree - at least 2:2 with Honours</li>
          <ul><p>Currently working towards this, with the finish university aim, that is mentioned below.</p></ul>
        <li><a href="skills.html#agile">Working well in a team</a></li>
          <ul><p>Again, I believe that the agile development section is also focused towards a group/team experience, and therefore have linked this information.</p></ul>
        <li>PPL Experience</li>
          <ul><p>Currently a PPL is out of my reach financially, and requires a greater financial investment than what I can currently invest towards this.</p></ul>
    </ul>
