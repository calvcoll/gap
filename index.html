  <p>The following is part of my graduate attribute portfolio, this includes my goals, my current skills, and an evaulation of what I need to do to enable myself to reach the goals that I have set out for myself.</p>
  <p>This document is written in HTML, without much CSS or JS, to enable myself to easily change the document without to many errors to worry about due to design problems. However this design choice, desires a bit of time to design from the ideas to a page, as the whole structure will have to be generated for this coursework, which will then be easily edittable after the huge commitment of time. This also comes with the benefit that it can run on most web browsers, back to 1995, due to it being complient to the HTML specification, with closed tags, or self-closing tags being used.</p>
  <p>Due to the nature of HTML this document will be a static document, however, it is easy to change and modify on the fly with basic understanding of HTML, and since the pages are separated, it shall be easy to find most parts with the hyperlinks placed on the text.</p>
  <h2><a href="aims.html">Aims</a></h2>
  <p>This page contains the current aims that I have for my future, although they are little, I've tried to find some information for these. Currently I have little ambition for what I want to do, and I am mainly leaning towards finishing university before I choose a career to follow. So my current ideas are on the page, and will be open to editting.</p>
  <h2><a href="skills.html">Skills</a></h2>
  <p>This contains the information about the current skills I possess, or believe myself to possess, so if I believe that my experience is lacking in a section it will not be included onto this page, an example of this is my knowledge of SOLID/DRY principles.</p>
  <h2><a href="todo.html">Current to-do list</a></h2>
  <p>This will contain all the information on what I need to currently improve upon, or get experience within, for example the aforementioned SOLID/DRY principles will be included in here, until I believe my experience is satisfactory to be included on the skills document/page.<p>
  <hr>
  <p>Unfortunately I haven't had the knowledge at this point to write this GAP into a web service to make it easier to edit. My future plan is to either to use the Grape framework, or Ruby on Rails framework to facilitate this. Each option can be dynamically changed hopefully in the future version.</p>
